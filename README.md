# TTRPG Guide

An apples-to-apples comparison chart for tabletop RPGs.

## Criteria

RPGs should only be included if they are:

- Not defunct (still actively sold and promoted)
- Well known (repeatedly mentioned in online conversation, and not by sockpuppet accounts) 

## Contributing

To expand or edit the list of RPGs, see data.json.

Add any new entries to the end of the list.
